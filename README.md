Age And Gender Detection
Age and gender detection using Python typically involves using machine learning models to analyze images or videos of faces. One popular approach is to use pre-trained deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for this purpose. In this example, I'll show you how to perform age and gender detection using the DeepFace library, which simplifies the process by providing a high-level API built on top of popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.
